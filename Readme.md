# Mus 88 Final Project
This is an algorithmically composed song created using Python, Quandl, and
CSound. It plays the 'song' of various stocks, indexes, and ETFs/ETNs.

## Setup

You will need [Quandl](https://docs.quandl.com/docs/python-installation) and
its dependencies installed.

Place your API key in a file called `quandl_key.secret`.

## Running

Run the CSound score generator file so aptly named `generator.py` using the command

```
python generator.py
```

## Configuration

I plan on adding command line arguments and other means of configuration at
some point. If you are reading this sufficiently far in the future, that point
is probably never (you can increase the chances of it being sooner by
contacting me).
